Welcome to the Rock Classification Project, a repository dedicated to the in-depth analysis of rock categorization based on 19 distinctive features, predicting rock types—namely, Igneous, Metamorphic, and Sedimentary. The dataset, derived from aggregateRockData.xlsx and norm540.txt files, is meticulously described on the dataset website for reference. This project encompasses essential components, including thorough data exploration featuring descriptive statistics and histograms to visualize feature distributions, along with the identification of attributes necessitating special treatment. Additionally, it delves into the intricate relationships between data attributes, employing the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and scatter plots for in-depth analysis.

Data splitting procedures ensure a balanced distribution with 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing, with thorough verification for representativeness in test and validation subsets. Model training and hyperparameter tuning involve three key classifiers: Multinomial Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest Classifier. The exploration of hyperparameters and subsequent reporting of performance metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score—provide comprehensive insights into model behavior.

Furthermore, the project explores ensemble learning by combining classifiers into an ensemble, evaluating its performance on the validation set, and subsequently applying the best-performing ensemble on the test set. The conclusion summarizes findings, insights, and encourages exploration, replication, and contributions to further enhance the rock classification model. Feel free to navigate through the repository, run the code, and contribute to this collaborative effort in refining rock classification methodologies.
